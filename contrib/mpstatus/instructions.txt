Place the perl scripts (rm .txt extension first!) in your cgi-bin;
they probably will need to be adjusted to suit, as a lot of the IP 
addresses etc. are hardcoded.  The code is pretty simple to follow though.

They need to use a local configured FG server with all the correct relays, so you
need to ensure all this is working.  I guess you could query a remote server,
but that isn't nice and network traffic would be a problem, I guess.

You will need 'netcat' and 'tac' (same as 'cat' but 'cats' backwards) 
installed, along with standard Perl.

To embed in HTML to produce the page, use:

<!--#exec cgi="cgi-bin/fg_run.pl" -->

<!--#exec cgi="cgi-bin/fg_status.pl" -->

etc.

IMPORTANT!!  Call the scripts something that nobody can guess to stop
idiots trying to run the script directly.

So, FG_RuNiTT.pl

and in the HTML:

<!--#exec cgi="cgi-bin/FG_RuNiTT.pl" --> 

etc.  ~ same for fg_status.pl

Any questions/issues, I will be glad to try to help.

libcli emulates a cisco style telnet command-line interface.

Get help by entering "help" or hitting ?.

libcli provides support for using the arrow keys for command-line editing.
Up and Down arrows will cycle through the command history, and Left & Right
can be used for editing the current command line.
libcli also works out the shortest way of entering a command, so if you
have a command "show users grep foobar" defined, you can enter "sh us g
foobar" if that is the shortest possible way of doing it.

Enter "sh?" at the command line to get a list of commands starting with
"sh"

A few commands are defined in every libcli program:
help
quit
exit
logout
history
